Some Assumptions :

We don't need any info on who is leading the book.
The user will only return the same book that he had borrowed.
We will return only the book which is with the library collection and was in the list of books before leading.
The list of books will contain only those books which are with the library collection's book.
If we add any book, then that book should not be included in our direct list of books | Add to library collection only.

... In the future, I will try to handle all these Assumptions.
